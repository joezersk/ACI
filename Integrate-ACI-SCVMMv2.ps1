.SYNOPSIS

Automates the steps necessary to generate, copy and install a cert for APIC to SCVMM Communication.

Script by Joseph Ezerski (joezersk@cisco.com), INSBU - No guarantees on operation! New v2.0 July 2016.
Now with more cowbell!
  
Special thanks to Chris Paggen for the APIC cookie code.

.DESCRIPTION

A quick way to generate a new cert for SCVMM and ACI Integration without the need to remember all the powershell commands. 
Accepts interactive user input to generate the cert on the SCVMM server, check for all installed ACI agents, 
copy the cert to a list of HyperV Hosts and place the cert into the ACI Admin account.

New in v2.0:
-More efficient and streamlined user input flow
-APIC password now masked on entry
-Better error checking by looking for the presence of needed ACI agents on SCVMM and HyperV hosts
-Prompt to install SCVMM Agent if it is missing
-Connection to APIC now using default HTTPS (TLSv1.2)

This script will set up the required certificate to build communication between APIC and SCVMM.  

After user provided input it will:
    -Create the certificate
    -Install it on the SCVMM Server
    -Copy it to the APIC admin X.509 cert store
    -Copy it to a list of hyperv hosts

It does provide some basic error checking to see if the SCVMM and HyperV agents are installed and running."),

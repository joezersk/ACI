#BEGIN SCRIPT
# Written by Joseph Ezerski (joezersk@cisco.com) Dec 2016. Not an official Cisco supported script. Use at your own risk.  
# This is a Powercli script meant to help you quickly move VMs off of one or more DVS networks and onto a local vSwitch.
# It will also offer to remove the physical ESX host from the DVS(s).  
# Finally it will log into your APIC and delete the VMM domain, which will remove the DVS from vCenter as well
# This is useful when you want to quickly remove a VMM Domain from your APIC and not spend hours right clicking to move VMs off
# Updated June 2017.  Be aware the DVS removal part at the end might not be perfect...
